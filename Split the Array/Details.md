# POTD: Split the Array

Given an array **arr[]** of integers, the task is to count the number of ways to split given array elements into two non-empty subsets such that the XOR of elements of each group is equal. Each element should belong to exactly one subset.\

Note:

- The answer could be very large so print it by doing modulo with 10<sup>9</sup> + 7. 
- Subsets with the same elements but derived from different indices are different.

### Examples:

>Input : arr[] = [1, 2, 3]\
>Output : 3\
>Explanation: {(1),(2, 3)}, {(2),(1, 3)}, {(3),(1, 2)} are three ways with equal XOR value of two groups.

>Input : arr[] = [5, 2, 3, 2]\
>Output : 0\
>Explanation: No way to split into  two groups whose XOR is equal.

>Input : arr[] = [2, 2, 2, 2]\
>Output : 7\
>Explanation: There are 7 ways to split the array into two groups with equal XOR, such that there are multiple combinations of {(2), (2,2,2)},{(2,2),(2,2)}.

### Constraints:
1<=arr.size()<=10<sup>6</sup>\
1<=arr[i]<=10<sup>6</sup>
